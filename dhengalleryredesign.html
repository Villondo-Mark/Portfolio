  <h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Introduction</h1>
  <br>
    <p>
    I was contacted by the owner of DHEN gallery, a vintage collection, to redesign their online storefront. During a later discussion at the gallery, it was determined that I would be the sole designer in charge of the project. Having accepted this job, I was left to determine the ultimate goal of the redesign project, perform research on related matters, and choose a direction in which to take the website. Aside from this, I would also do photo editing and mockups for the owner when asked to.</p><br>

    <h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Process</h1><br>
    
    <p>Organizing the project timeline, I divided the tasks into a logical order before applying my own methods, that is, dabbling in different tasks during the same time segments such as research, brainstorming, and sketching in order for creativity to flow. With a hybrid approach, by exposing myself to different ideas during this stage while, in the same span of time, juggling potentially useful concepts for the project around in my head, the prospects for serendipity to occur are increased while also allowing me compare to ideas against a general set of criterion for the project as whole, though not necessarily at this step of the design process yet. The following criterion set was designed as a general guideline for reaching the ultimate goal.</p><br><br>
    
    <p class="list">- Users are encouraged to explore the website<br>
    - Users are exposed to potential interests<br>
    - User can find specific pages and pieces of information in 3-4 clicks<br>
    - Users will find that the website looks professional and trustworthy<br>
    - User interest maintained by exposing them to information related to their specific needs</p><br><br>
    
    <p>Admittedly, the start of these projects can take the longest, especially as the sole designer. However, the freedom that comes with it includes the creative agency and allowance to build a strong foundation on which to build the project on, mitigating some potential problems with design decisions made at the start with which we can derive an almost definitive direction to take this project.</p>
    
    <p>The original designer had already laid some of the foundations that I would later use to continue the redesign, including parts of the logo, the colors, and the images used. Beyond that, I reviewed the organization of the products and their pages, later determining that the layout and organization of the products needed redoing due to the sheer variety and lack of consistent details with which to categorize them more accurately and clearly.</p><br><br>

    <div class="dhenlogo">

              </div><br><br>
    
    <p>Having taken the project over from its original designer, I was hoping that there would be at least a few pointers taken from research that I could use to direct myself towards. To my disappointment, neither they nor the company itself had any information that they could provide me despite already having a layout for their pages.</p>
    
    <p>The subjects of my research would be my target audience and other online storefronts in the same industry. While doing research, I would write down some of my impressions. In the beginning, I was looking at the page compositions of popular and successful storefronts in the same market before moving on to content organization. From my impressions on my client’s website, I figured that there was no real rhyme or rhythm to how the products were presented and organized aside from what felt like the bare minimum. I wanted to reorganize the presentation on the front page to really draw in potential customers using vintage and paintings that could really reflect the unique collection gathered by this gallery. </p>
    
    <p>By the end of my research stage, I figured that I’d gathered enough data to support my ideas for a new composition and reorganization of the web content. I also came up with a number of ideas to help draw in customers. Some of these include:</p><br><br>
    
    <p class="list">- Using an impressive painting I found in the gallery as a front page banner<br>
      - Use location advantage as a way to imply high-status as a gallery<br>
      - Present products in a dignified manner to imply class<br>
      - Composition-conscious organization of web pages to present customers with information that may influence a buy while avoiding information overload</p><br><br>
    
    <p>Before composing any wireframes and putting any ideas to practice, I needed to create a set of criteria that could be backed up by my research. The set goes as follows:</p><br><br>
    
    <p class="list"><b>Priority 1:</b><br>
      - Users will find that information and products are easy to find and understand, taking less than 5 clicks to gain access to specific pieces of content. (Efficiency, Visibility, Mapping)<br>
      - Users will think that the website looks clean and professional so that they feel comfortable inputting their information for purchases and further explore the site. (Trust, Motivation)<br><br>
    <b>Priority 2:</b><br>
    - Users will find that the website is similar to most other online storefronts and feel more confident that they can navigate it efficiently. (Familiarity)<br>
    Users will quickly come to understand and familiarize themselves with the organization and layout of the website. (Learnability)<br>
    - User will find that composition for similar pages. (products and sections) are consistently organized (Mapping, Simplicity)
    </p><br><br>
    
    <p>After composing a set of wireframes and reviewing it multiple times to make sure that they were keeping in line with my prioritized criterion, I began to write up the proposal for my client. This would consist of the following:</p>
    
    <p class="list">- The same set of colors being carried over from the site I was left to redesign<br>
      - New organization of product pages and sections<br>
      - New compositions for all web pages and product pages<br>
      - Logo with some elements being carried over from the original<br>
      - SEO updates<br>
      - Images to be used; photos of objects to be subject to editing and reuse for things such as mastheads, banners, etc.<br>
      - Promotion using location as ideal spot for vintage gallery<br>
      - Project timeline<br>
      - Some research used and organized to support the ideas used<br>
      - The criteria list on which most, if not all, design choices were compared against</p><br><br><br>


      <a class="blackLink" href="" target="_blank">Link to Wireframes</a><br><br>
    
    
      <h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Samples from Proposal</h1><br>

</div>

<br><br>
    
    <p>After reviewing the proposal, the client approved and I began working on the visual elements such as photo editing and a banner, as well as making sure that the redesign wouldn’t be stunted due to the limitations on Godaddy as a website builder. I found that the advantages of website builders were that it enabled designers to streamline the process, but only within the limitations of Godaddy. Indeed, there were numerous times where I needed to make changes to the design due to a lack of control in certain areas of the web builder, such as limited access to fonts behind a premium paywall. However, for the most part, I was able to overcome these issues with some flexibility.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, due to differences in opinion, lack of communication, and an overall lack of preparation, the project is currently on an indefinite hiatus. I have little reason to feel confident in it returning as well.
