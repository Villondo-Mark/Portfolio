            <p>Transitioning students from traditional in-class learning to an online curriculum is no easy task, with some potential issues being the speed at which it becomes necessary to achieve proficiency with a new application, the difficulty in learning all the important functions of said application, and in keeping the students engaged with the work that needs to be done.</p>

              <p>This project aims to solve the aforementioned problem by designing an educational application with a UI that supports the user while mitigating any of the potential issues previously stated in order to facilitate the transition from traditional classroom academics to the online platform that is not only suited to the user, but also encourages the user to stay on task consistently.</p></div>

<h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Introduction</h1>



<p><br>
        At the time that this project was conceived, the world was in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. As a result, many schools and universities had gone completely remote for all academic purposes. With that, the strengths and weaknesses of online schooling would become more apparent. <br><br>
        While I'd already accumulated experience with online learning, I thought about how everyone else was handling the shift to this new reality. As a university student, I had a greater degree of freedom and flexibility over my own education. However, when I thought about how this might have affected my high school experience, I asked myself: would my school have been able to transition to online learning effectively? And would the students be able to handle such a major change to their daily routine? <br><br>
        Upon further research, I found a common trend being done by institutions all over the world: the distribution of electronic tablets, done so for students to continue their education even in the midst of the pandemic. While Zoom was known to have had an important role in supporting education (and almost every other major industry), it was still just one function among many that supported the academic system. In realizing this, I understood just how fractured the current educational experience must be, with students having to adjust to a new platform while juggling through different applications just to complete their assignments.<br><br>
        To break down the situation further, the concept of learnability, as it exists in the components of usability, could not be effectively applied due to the speed at which schools were forced to shift to online learning. If one were to apply and refine this concept towards facilitating this emergency transition, it would help to solve, or at least mitigate, the issues of shifting an entire generation of students to an online portal. <br><br>
        This line of hypothesizing would eventually become the driving idea behind this project: to design a User Interface that focuses on its users (students) and the difficulties they face due to the sudden and forced transition to online learning.</p><br>


        <h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Project Overview/ Scope</h1><br>
        <p>
        This project challenges the current state of online education and how it adapts students from the traditional in-classroom educational experience to an online educational curriculum, which was caused largely by the viral spread of covid-19, and attempts to facilitate said transition by adapting the educational workspace (the application User Interface) to suit the users (students) needs and support them in their educational pursuits. <br><br>
For this project, the focus will be on the primary user (student) end of the interaction framework rather than the teacher or administrator end. All visuals and designs will also be done with tablets as the primary platform.</p><br>

<h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Challenges and Restraints</h1><p><br>
For this project, the biggest challenge was collecting the data I needed, with it becoming an issue that would end up altering the project scope. Luckily, with schools already segmented between elementary, middle, and high school, my data collecting segments were practically prepared for me. Following my original plan, I obtained the data from middle and high school students. However, getting anything from elementary school students would prove the most difficult. This was due, in no small part, to the strain on communication at that time, during the height of the covid-19 pandemic. Getting accurate first-hand data from elementary school students was difficult enough normally, but the circumstances at the time made it exponentially more difficult. Rather than dwell on the issue and stagnating project, I decided to move forward by adjusting the scope of the project to focus on middle and high school students instead of all K-12 students.<br><br>
</p>

<hr id="wbhr"><br>

<p>
Going into this project, I had several ideas that I would consider for a new UI design concept. First, I gathered what relevant data I could, however, this is also where the biggest obstacle would lie. Please see [Challenges and Restraints] for an explanation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​<br><br>
 
The data I obtained was taken through use of questionnaires, segmented into middle school and high school students. With that data, I went created two personas, Sage and Jayda. A pair of middle and high school students, respectively. <br><br><br>

<div class="list">
Sage is a 8th grade student currently in middle school. Much of her time is spent in communication with her friends and hobbies.  She is, to a degree, studious, and maintains her grades on a satisfactory level. Sage’s technological literacy is still growing, though she has already accumulated experience by using applications such as Tiktok and Discord. She is confident that she'd be able to figure out how to use any application as long with continued use. <br><br>
Jayda, a 12th grade high school student, spends much time in communication with friends, on academics, extracurricular activities, and hobbies. She values efficiency because it allows her to stay on top off things, using the free time however she wishes. Jayda prides herself on the ability to balance all these aspects of her life. She is technologically fluent and a user of commonly used applications such as Tiktok, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, as well as niche applications such as Be Real.

<br><br>

Using these personas as well as the collection of data they are based on, I organized a contextual set of the variables of usability and made a criterion list:</p><br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="list"><b>Priority 1:</b><br>
        - A novice user will be able to login, navigate, and perform their required tasks using the system interface and quickly achieve at least partial proficiency with consistent use over the next couple of hours or days. (Learnability, Simplicity, Mapping)<br>
        - The user will be motivated to use the application to complete their required tasks with the assistance of effective feedback from the system, thus being more motivated to complete the required tasks. (Motivation, Trust)<br><br>
        <b>Priority 2:</b><br>
        - The user will be able to find any piece of content within 3-5 clicks on the interface. (Efficiency, Mapping)<br>
        - The user will feel in control of the system. (Trust)<br>
        - The user will find that all the content they need will be available when they need it. - The user will be able to fulfill their intentions when looking at the interface for each step of the execute sequence (interaction framework). (Visibility, Mapping)<br><br>
        <b>Priority 3:</b><br>
        - The user will develop a basic mental map of the application. (Simplicity)<br>
        - The user will understand the use of visual metaphors that are indicative of their related functions. (Mapping)</p><br><br>

        <p>With my criterion organized, I began conducting the design phase with a depth first search, compiling ideas taken from other interfaces. Starting off, I experimented with the vision of an ideal interface that I had in mind, contemplating how I could apply and adapt them to suit the applications needs as well as with fulfilling the criterion. I borrowed concepts from the online portal of the university I graduated from and took notes from commonly applications used such as Google Drive, then applying, drawing, and repeatedly scrapping ideas until I had composition that seemed like a start in the right direction.<br><br>
            After further refinements, those experiments would lead me to creating mockups, later turning into paper prototypes for the first testing phase.</p>

            <p>The design process for the paper prototype was made by consulting the personas, Sage and Jayda, as well as the criterion list. The purpose of this first round of testing was to observe and measure the results against the criterion in order to gauge if the design was headed in a direction that was worth refining.<br><br>
                After passing the initial round with generally satisfactory results, ideas for refinements to more accurately fulfill the criterion would be contemplated and later applied, this time on high-fidelity mockups made on Adobe Indesign later Adobe XD to create an interactive prototype closer to the intended final product. This process of continued testing and refinement would continue two more times after the first round, with the last being for finer tuning.

                  <h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Conclusion/ Final Thoughts</h1><p><br>

                <p>At the end of this project, I found a greater understanding and appreciation for the process and science behind designing for people and was able to better gauge how to apply ideas and turn them into solutions towards fulfilling project goals.</p><br><br>
