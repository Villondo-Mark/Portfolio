<h1 class="header"> &nbsp;Commission: Magic the Gathering Proxy - Codie, Vociferous Codex</h1><br>

<p>&nbsp;This was a commissioned project by my friend, Nick, an avid MTG fan and player. Magic the Gathering is a popular tcg game consisting of spells in the form of cards that perform various effects with the intended purpose of winning a game which is held between players. For this project, I was asked to design a proxy, a fake card that can be used in the place of a real card outside of official capacities, for a creature card named "Codie", who is basically a talking book. The style I am known to use for illustrations in this manner is hand drawn using pen. While not done in any serious capacity (simply because it looks charming in its own way), I decided to take it a step further by also designing a proxy on Illustrator.</p>

<p>The inspiration for designing this card came from my "client" himself, he made claims that Codie was once depicted as "a Brooklyn native."" Doing my own research, I figured that using several indicators to depcit Codie in this way would suffice. This indicators would consist of Timberland boots, a Yankees cap (with brim), an obnoxious, steretypical phrase, and a hot dog for the hand drawn version and a "cawfee" (coffee) for the illustrator version. </p>

<p> Overall, this was a fun project to undertake and I would love to do more. In fact, I have another non-committal commission by another friend who we also play with. When it gets finished, it will be uploaded, whenever that will be.</p>

<h1 class="header"> &nbsp;Nautica Watch - Illustrator Rendition</h1><br>

  <p>&nbsp;This was an interesting project, both at the time and in hindsight. The watch is actually one that I own myself, given to me more than a decade ago, thought I can't remember whether it was given to me or that I inherited it. Regardless, I actually quite enjoyed this project as it gave me the opportunity to encounter problems and solve them myself repeatedly. It was a valuable experience that helped hone my skills in both problem solving and illustrator itself.</p>
  <p>In order to recreate an accurate representation of this watch on Illustrator, precision and accuracy were absolutely critical at every step. Because everything was interconnected, when one thing failed, it affected another part. In hindsight, I liken this to the building a watch. Every gear, every piece, and every single minute detail needed to be built and placed exactly as it was in the planning stage or else it would certainly fail, no matter if everything else was perfect. However, unlike in watch building, errors in Illustrator do not punish nearly as much for a single mistake, although it could also snowball into bigger problems is not taken care of properly.</p>
  <p>I would say that of all the Illustrator projects I've undertaken. this is the one that both challenged and rewarded me the most. Learning to solve problems that I encountered and how to improvise for when things don't pan out the way I expect were both skills that I thought I already had, but doing so in this context really helped improve my confidence with vector illustrations.</p>

<h1 class="header"> &nbsp;Large Sticker w/ Animation (AfterEffects)</h1><br>

  <p>&nbsp;When coming up for ideas, I got to thinking about a couple of things that eventually led to the creation of this sticker and the animation that came after it. For one, I am a fan of the animated movie <i>Anastasia</i> and one song in particular named "Once Upon a December". I was also thinking of the ballet <i>Swan Lake</i> and my appreciation for its aesthetic. Eventually, the concept I had in mind would be a combination of these things in the form of music box-like presentation. </p>
  <p>This would work well within the context of this project, almost literally. As a sticker needed to be an encased space that was self-contained and complete, so too was a music box. Somehow, I ended up implementing this concept in the form of a glass display case that embodied everything that I was trying to accomplish, hence the shape of the sticker and the composition of its contents. </p>
  <p>In order to animate this sticker, I wound up using Adobe After Effects, a program that I was unfamiliar with. Having been taught the basics, I had to acquire skill proficiency with experimentation. Thankfully, the mental and emotional energy I had already poured into this project allowed me to continue pushing forward with that same passion. I was able to use a piano cover of the aforementioned song <i>Once Upon a December</i> in my animation to add to the aesthetic I was aiming for, and the link to the song can be found in the video posted.</p>
  <p>I would say that I am overall satisfied with this project, although I do wish, in hindsight, that I had paid more attention to certain details. However, I'd like to leave this finished work as it is as both a reminder and a sign to myself and what I was able to accomplish this, and use it as a benchmark for later works. Leaving it in it's current state to more accurately reflect the "me" of that time allows for better contemplation when going through it again.</p>
