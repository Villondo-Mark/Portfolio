<h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Introduction</h1>

<p>I was assigned to a two-man team whose goal was to redesign the the website for an online marketing company. Our team was assigned to write a proposal with redesigns for all webpages, and held what was effectively complete creative control. </p><br>

<h1 class="header"> &nbsp; Introduction</h1><br>

<p>While we were put into a team and given our assignment, there was no designated leader and no set schedule. Because of this, I began to facilitate discussion on our goals, research subjects, timetables, and ideas in order to start forming a plan. Once we reaffirmed our goal, we each took it upon ourselves to assign roles according to the timetable, starting with a research and study phase.  Aside from doing research, we both acknowledged that the interface we were using, Squarespace, was not designed with flexibility in mind. We then agreed to explore and experiment with it in order to become competent users. After a week of research, we came together at a designated time and discussed what we researched and what other ideas we had. Seeing that we were making decent progress, I suggested that we divide the pages for redesign between the two of us. Having agreed, my partner and I then took another week to begin composing wireframes based on our research and ideas.</p><br><br>

  <p>It was sometime between the third and fourth week where we were told that we'd be getting a new team member. With that in mind, my partner and I held off on continuing to divide our roles in order to faciliate the transition for our new addition. When they did arrive for the next meeting, we got her up to speed and shared what documents and research we had for her to look over. We talked about how we were organizing ourselves into different roles and discussed our timetable to try and get her on the same page. After talking about our progress, we all decided that we would continue with the plan we had in place, reorganizing the roles to include her. We didn't have too much trouble with this as one might expect because there were still plenty of things, such as design decisions, that were either not yet discussed or not set in stone.</p>
  <p>Continuing from there, the things that were done individually were the compositions making up our wireframes, moving then to discussion and critiquing them as a group for refinement. We then did testing in the form of questionaires to see if we'd made progress towards having a working prototype. The data was collected using google's questionaire services and further discussed the results and impressions we had during our next meeting, writing down important points and then making the changes for the next round of testing. This would happen once more before coming to the conclusion that our wireframes were sufficient enough to present in our proposal together with the testing results and our conclusions.
  Some other details we discussed and contemplated on were the logo and color palette to be used, in which we would keep the latter while making minor adjustments to the former using Photoshop and Illustrator. We also found stock photos to use and, after getting them approved by each other team member added them to our assets. Included in our proposal were some mockups as well.</p>
  <p>After presenting our case and handing in our proposal, we were contacted and given the go ahead to start implementing the redesign. We immediately got to work organizing the roles we would take and agreed to talk about any problems we would encounter. There were, of course, a handful that we would end up facing. I should also reiterate that we were using Squarespace, which wasn't designed with a real web designer in mind, hence the preprepared templates and lack of real flexibility that we would have liked. In cases where this was an issue, we would try to find other resources that could help mitigate these problems. Some solutions that we found were extensions that enabled us to find the hex number on any color on a webpage, as well as an element and id finder for CSS editing purposes. There were a handful of tricks we needed to implement, such as ways to include code in a way that Squarespace itself did not intend. With the support of our fellow team members, we were able to implement our redesign that was mostly accurate to our proposal.</p>
